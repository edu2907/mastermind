# Mastermind
A code-breaking game for two players.

Made with Ruby for the [Mastermind Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind) from The Odin Project

This project certainly was one of the most challenging I made at the  
time I was writing this README, but it worthed the effort since I got   
more coomprehensive about OOP principles, specially refactoring code.

Obs: Originaly, the idea was to use the Knuth algoritm to break the code,  
but I didn't understand well how algoritm works at the time i, so I made  
some sort of a "variant" that follows some principles of the algoritm,  
but doesn't always wins in five turns. And this was unintentional, so  
there is some commits that refers the algoritm as 'Donald Knuth algoritm',  
just keep in mind that refers to my variant, not the actual Knuth algoritm.
